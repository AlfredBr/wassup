# wassup
**wassup** is the simplest chat program

There are two implementations of the backend: 

* /js - implemented in NodeJS, ExpressJS and socket.io
* /go - implemented in Go (but the websocket code not finished yet...)

The intent is for the .html and .css to be identical, but each version has their own copy for now.
